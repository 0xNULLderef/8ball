# 8ball

a shitpost i made at school for an html5 js excercise

steal code as you wish, fix the ball rolling, add actual logic to this demo, use a matrix to fix rotation, whatever. don't need to credit me, again, this is a shitpost :3
anyways, have fun!
(what, did you expect me to write a serious readme for this? in what world.)
